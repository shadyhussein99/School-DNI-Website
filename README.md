# School-DNI-Website
Structuring the website of School-DNI company located in Emirates, which makes offers for parents who pays educational fees for maximum 4 children. The website calculates the fees for the children for 5 years. The parent should get different offers according to wheather he is paying fees above or below 500000 AED in 5 years, but unfortunately the project stopped for company issues.

Using react-hook-form to control the form and yup in validating inputs
